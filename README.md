# Salary_prediction_ANN
This is a web-based application built using Streamlit and TensorFlow Keras that predicts a customer's estimated salary based on key features like age, geography, credit score, balance, tenure, number of products, and account status. The app uses a trained neural network regression model with preprocessing techniques including label encoding for gender, one-hot encoding for geography, and feature scaling with StandardScaler. Users can enter customer details through the interactive interface, and the app provides the predicted salary in real-time.
